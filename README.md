# ShopicruitFall17
 android app made to show the number of Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboard and the total revenue of a Shopify Merchent

### it was made using:
* Native Android
* RxJava: because Observables are so nice
* Retrofit: IMO the nicest way to network on android
* Gson: Super easy JSON parsing in java

I didn't really get why you said to only parse the first page 
(Why would there be multpile pages if you only wanted us to use one?)
Just incase I missinterpreted to question, I also parsed all the pages using a beautiful but probably slow recursive algorithm, and also showed for only on page.
