# ShopicruitFall17
 android app made to show the number of Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboard and the total revenue of a Shopify Merchent

### it was made using:
* Native Android
* RxJava: because Observables are so nice
* Retrofit: IMO the nicest way to network on android
* Gson: Super easy JSON parsing in java
